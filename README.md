Day 3 focuses on cryptography, one of the core pillars of cybersecurity. This module covers the theoretical principles, practical implementations, and intermediate-level techniques essential for securing communications, data storage, and authentication systems. The notes balance historical context, modern algorithms, and applied cryptography in enterprise security.

Modes of operation (ECB, CBC, CTR, GCM)

Strengths and weaknesses

Asymmetric Encryption

RSA fundamentals

Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Hashing & Integrity

MD5, SHA family (SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3)

bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2

Salting, peppering, and password storage

Digital Signatures & Certificates

PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

Certificate Authorities (CA), chain of trust
