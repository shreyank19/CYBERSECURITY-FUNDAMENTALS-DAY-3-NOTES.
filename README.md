# CYBERSECURITY-FUNDAMENTALS-DAY-3-NOTES.
Day 3 covers cryptography up to intermediate level, including classical ciphers, symmetric (DES, AES), asymmetric (RSA, Diffieâ€“Hellman, ECC), hashing (MD5, SHA, bcrypt, Argon2), digital signatures, PKI, SSL/TLS, and cryptanalysis basics. Focuses on confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and real-world security applications.
