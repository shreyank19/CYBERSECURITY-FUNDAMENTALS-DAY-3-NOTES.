# CYBERSECURITY-FUNDAMENTALS-DAY-3-NOTES.
Day 3 covers cryptography up to intermediate level, including classical ciphers, symmetric (DES, AES), asymmetric (RSA, Diffieâ€“Hellman, ECC), hashing (MD5, SHA, bcrypt, Argon2), digital signatures, PKI, SSL/TLS, and cryptanalysis basics. Focuses on confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and real-world security applications.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: Cryptography (Foundations to Intermediate Level)

Day 3 focuses on cryptography, one of the core pillars of cybersecurity. This module covers the theoretical principles, practical implementations, and intermediate-level techniques essential for securing communications, data storage, and authentication systems. The notes balance historical context, modern algorithms, and applied cryptography in enterprise security.
